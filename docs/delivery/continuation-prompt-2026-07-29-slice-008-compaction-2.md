# Slice 008 continuation after second context compaction

Work in `C:\Users\HP\Desktop\mvp`.

This is the standalone continuation prompt for:

`SLICE-008 — notifications_reporting_and_audit`.

Working context compacted a second time during incomplete implementation. Work
stopped immediately under the mandatory checkpoint rule. Resume only after
reconstructing context from the repository. Do not infer correctness or
verification from this prompt's summary.

Do not repeat Slice 007 publication/integration. Do not recreate the Slice 008
branch. Do not open a pull request or integrate Slice 008 into `main`. Do not
begin another slice.

## Required reading and initial inspection

Read in full and in this order:

1. `AGENTS.md`
2. `docs/index.md`
3. `docs/delivery/handoff-2026-07-29-slice-008-checkpoint.md`
4. `docs/delivery/implementation-progress.md`
5. `docs/delivery/mvp-slices.yaml`
6. `docs/delivery/slice-008-notifications-reporting-and-audit.md`
7. `docs/delivery/continuation-prompt-2026-07-29-slice-008.md`
8. this continuation prompt

The original Slice 008 execution prompt remains authoritative for scope,
quality, verification, publication boundaries, and exclusions. Its Slice 007
publication and Slice 008 branch-creation steps are complete and must not be
re-executed.

Before changing repository state, activate the pinned toolchain:

```powershell
fnm env --shell powershell | Out-String | Invoke-Expression
fnm use 24.18.0 | Out-Null
```

Require `node --version` to be exactly `v24.18.0`.

Then use read-only checks to inspect:

- current branch, `HEAD`, local `main`, and `origin/main`;
- all branches, upstreams, recent history, and independent remote refs;
- complete staged, tracked, and untracked worktree state;
- the full diff and contents of every Slice 008 edit;
- the exact protected `.cc-history` paths and hashes;
- `.tmp` content;
- PostgreSQL processes and listeners, including ports `5432` and `55437`; and
- whether any command or external operation is in flight.

At this checkpoint, require:

- active branch:
  `slice-008-notifications-reporting-and-audit`;
- `HEAD`, local `main`, and `origin/main`:
  `1a5c265a455a9fa758c5495b3a963570849b9181`;
- no Slice 008 upstream or remote ref;
- nothing staged;
- only the application and documentation paths listed below, plus the two
  protected untracked `.cc-history` files;
- no isolated Slice 008 database;
- unrelated PostgreSQL parent PID `7236` listening on `5432`, unchanged;
- port `55437` free; and
- no Slice 008 command in flight.

Any unexpected ref, remote branch, staged path, worktree path,
protected-file hash, temporary file, listener/process change, isolated
database, or unexplained artifact is a conflict. Stop and report it. Do not
repair, discard, rewrite, reset, clean, rebase, or force-push.

Never stage, remove, rewrite, or broadly clean `.cc-history` or `.tmp`. Never
stop, reuse, or delete the unrelated PostgreSQL cluster on port `5432`.

## Completed prerequisite evidence

Slice 007 is fully published and verified:

- implementation:
  `6c167913edaaeff7b5e47e0999b950efd7ffbae7`;
- feature publication/integration head:
  `db38e98b169375650dadb9534e5ab65567234552`;
- exact integration CI run `30456268068`: successful;
- main-publication record:
  `1a5c265a455a9fa758c5495b3a963570849b9181`; and
- exact documentation CI run `30456680467`: successful.

Both runs passed `verify` and `dependency-audit`. Do not repeat these actions.

## Known draft progress and defect

Work attempted before the second compaction includes:

- migration and journal structures for notification tasks, reporting
  projections, outbox processing/retries/quarantine/replay/retention, and
  tenant permission-template state;
- a generic PostgreSQL outbox processor with leasing, ordering, retry,
  quarantine, replay, checkpoint, and retention behavior;
- notification recipient resolution, notification inbox/task actions,
  critical-gap queries, retention, and SSE polling hints;
- reporting projection rebuild, operational dashboard, and paginated sales
  report;
- audit querying;
- tenant-scoped predefined permission-template deactivation;
- active-work guards for branch and table deactivation;
- API and worker composition;
- OpenAPI and event-contract changes; and
- staff notification, dashboard, sales-report, and audit workspaces.

All are unverified drafts. Presence does not imply correctness.

The last large UI patch returned truncated output. Read-only inspection
confirmed that `apps/web/staff/src/InsightsWorkspaces.tsx` exists, while
`apps/web/staff/src/App.tsx` contains this known syntax defect:

```typescript
  | "Audit";
  | "Notifications";
```

The imports landed, but navigation and rendered workspace integration were
not established by the truncated result. Inspect both complete files before
repairing them. Do not assume the new UI satisfies permissions, responsive
behavior, runtime validation, actionable errors, or WCAG requirements.

## Re-establish the Slice 008 normative boundary

All eight stories were `mvp` and `ready` before compaction:

- `US-A03`;
- `US-O01`, `US-O02`, and `US-O03`;
- `US-P01` and `US-P02`; and
- `US-Q01` and `US-Q02`.

Before continuing behavior changes, repeat the complete `AGENTS.md` normative
reading order from source:

1. their full stories, acceptance criteria, and applicable NFRs in
   `restaurant-management-system-requirements.md`;
2. `docs/product/mvp-scope.yaml`;
3. relevant decisions in `docs/product/decision-register.md`;
4. `docs/domain/model.md`, `docs/domain/workflows.yaml`, and
   `docs/domain/business-rules.md`;
5. `docs/config/features.yaml` and `docs/security/permissions.yaml`;
6. `docs/architecture/modules.yaml`, `docs/architecture/consistency.md`, the
   ADR index, and every relevant accepted ADR;
7. `docs/architecture/express-implementation-guide.md`;
8. the complete affected HTTP and event contracts;
9. `docs/data/model.md`, `docs/quality/test-strategy.md`, and
   `docs/quality/traceability.yaml`; and
10. every existing outbox, worker, audit, identity/scope, configuration,
    ordering, Kitchen, Payments, Tables, administration, staff UI, and test
    pattern that Slice 008 extends.

Compare approved sources by their declared authority. Stop and report exact
conflicting IDs if a conflict exists. Do not invent a threshold, recipient
strategy, retention exception, privacy action, state, permission, event, or
product decision.

The prior reviews found no approved-source conflict. They interpreted
`AC-US-P01-01` with `PD-036` as allowing elapsed-time presentation, not
delay/urgency classification or a delay threshold. Verify that conclusion
from source before relying on it.

## Resume implementation safely

Review every current edit for:

- exact source-module and table-write ownership;
- tenant, restaurant, branch, assignment, permission, and effective-feature
  scope;
- transactional outbox boundaries;
- idempotency, leasing, aggregate ordering, checkpoint, retry, restart,
  poison-event, quarantine, replay, rebuild, retention, and concurrency
  behavior;
- PostgreSQL 18.1 compatibility, constraints, foreign keys, and indexes;
- sensitive-data minimization and actionable failure behavior; and
- compliance with existing architecture, contracts, and naming conventions.

Correct or replace drafts when authoritative sources and existing patterns
require it. Then finish the smallest complete vertical Slice 008 outcome
across migration, domain/application code, PostgreSQL adapters, worker
composition, runtime-validated HTTP/event contracts, and responsive,
permission-aware staff/administration UI.

Preserve every behavior, ownership, exclusion, deactivation boundary,
reporting rule, notification rule, audit rule, and UI/test requirement from
the original execution prompt. Do not introduce a broker, microservice split,
generic repository, dynamic workflow engine, external notification provider,
report export, menu/stock reporting, currency conversion, hard deletion, or
general privacy-deletion workflow.

Keep the declaration status `planned` until every Definition of Done check is
supported by exact final evidence.

## Verification state and required final verification

Only these preliminary commands completed before the final UI patch:

- `corepack pnpm typecheck`: passed on the then-current backend worktree.
- `corepack pnpm contracts:lint`: passed on the then-current backend worktree,
  reporting a valid OpenAPI document and 43 integration event contracts.

They do not verify the current worktree and must not be used as final
evidence.

Migration `0007` has not been applied. No isolated Slice 008 database exists.
No final format, lint, typecheck, test, architecture, contract, build,
browser/WCAG, full-check, dependency-audit, or visual-review evidence exists.

After implementation is complete, create a new isolated PostgreSQL 18.1
database for final verification and record its exact database, port, process,
and native data/log paths. Do not reuse the unrelated listener on `5432`.
Apply every migration from empty and supply `TEST_DATABASE_URL` so integration
tests cannot skip.

With Node.js `24.18.0`, run the exact repository commands:

```powershell
corepack pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
corepack pnpm format:check
corepack pnpm lint
corepack pnpm typecheck
corepack pnpm test
corepack pnpm test:architecture
corepack pnpm contracts:lint
corepack pnpm build
corepack pnpm test:browser
corepack pnpm check
corepack pnpm audit --prod --audit-level high
```

Run and record the complete responsive browser/WCAG suite and visual
inspection required by the original prompt. An earlier, focused, interrupted,
or pre-final-worktree run does not verify the final worktree.

Update implementation, migrations, contracts, architecture/consistency,
conceptual data model, configuration/permissions if required by approved
scope, traceability, the Slice 008 declaration, progress, index, and final
handoff atomically. Do not add an unlinked `TBD`.

Do not claim completion until every original acceptance, verification,
worktree-review, isolated-database cleanup, port-free, documentation, and
Definition of Done requirement is satisfied.

## Publication boundary

Only after full final verification:

1. review the complete diff, status, branch, base, and protected paths;
2. stage only Slice 008 files;
3. confirm `.cc-history` and temporary database artifacts are not staged;
4. commit with an accurate conventional commit message;
5. push only `slice-008-notifications-reporting-and-audit` to its matching
   remote branch;
6. verify the remote ref independently against local `HEAD`; and
7. record exact implementation and publication evidence.

Do not open a pull request, merge, rebase, squash, force-push, integrate Slice
008 into `main`, begin post-MVP work, or start another slice without explicit
authorization.

## Mandatory context-compaction instruction

If working context compacts at any point before the current phase is fully
completed, verified, and safely checkpointed, stop immediately. Do not
continue integration, implementation, testing, staging, committing, pushing,
cleanup, or publication from summarized memory.

Perform only the minimum read-only inspection needed to capture the exact
branch, `HEAD`, refs, worktree, protected paths, database/process state,
commands in flight, and known/unknown verification results. Never infer that
an interrupted command passed.

Then refresh the active handoff and
`docs/delivery/implementation-progress.md`, create a new dated standalone
continuation prompt containing the complete current state and this same
context-compaction instruction, and return control to the user.
